=== (S.6) Verification and acceptance criteria

ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Specification of the conditions under which an implementation will be deemed satisfactory. Here, "verification" as shorthand for what is more explicitly called "Verification & Validation" (V&V), covering several levels of testing — module testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing — as well as other techniques such as static analysis and, when applicable, program proving._  <<BM22>>

Verification and validation of the *{project-title}* system will be conducted through a comprehensive series of testing and evaluation processes to ensure the functionality, reliability, and usability of the implemented features.

- *Functional Verification*: The system's components, including the Order Management, Delivery Tracking, and User Interface, will undergo rigorous testing to validate that they meet the specified functional requirements. This will involve unit testing, integration testing, and system testing to confirm the correct execution of each component and their interactions.
- *User Acceptance Testing*: The *{project-title}* system will be subjected to user acceptance testing involving actual end-users. Users will be tasked with scenarios such as placing orders, tracking deliveries, and managing loyalty points. Successful completion of these tasks and positive user feedback will validate the user-friendliness and effectiveness of the system.
- *Performance Evaluation*: The system's response times, scalability, and efficiency will be measured under varying load conditions to ensure it performs optimally even during peak usage periods. The system's performance will be compared against predefined benchmarks to determine its responsiveness and stability.
- *Security Assessment*: Rigorous security testing will be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and ensure data protection. The system's interactions with user data, payment processing, and authentication mechanisms will be assessed to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.
- *Compatibility Testing*: The *{project-title}* system will be evaluated for compatibility across various devices, operating systems, and web browsers to ensure consistent and seamless functionality across different user environments.

Upon successful completion of these verification and validation processes, the system will be considered acceptable for deployment, ensuring that it aligns with the defined requirements and provides a reliable and user-friendly experience for all stakeholders involved.
