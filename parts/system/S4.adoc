ifdef::env-draft[]
TIP: _Examples of interaction between the environment (or human users) and the system, expressed as user stories. Such scenarios are not by themselves a substitute for precise descriptions of functionality (<<s3>>), but provide an important complement by specifying cases that these behavior descriptions must support; they also serve as a basis for developing test cases. The scenarios most relevant for stakeholders are given in chapter <<g5>> in the Goals book, at a general level, as use cases; in contrast, <<s4>> can refer to system components and functionality (from other chapters of the System book) as well as special and erroneous cases, and introduce more specific scenarios._  <<BM22>>

==== Overview

The following list presents a set of key scenarios that illustrate the core interactions and functionalities of the *{project-title}* app. These scenarios provide a comprehensive overview of how users, delivery personnel, and administrators will engage with the system to achieve their respective goals and ensure seamless order management, delivery tracking, and restaurant integration.

- **Placing a New Food Order**: A user logs in, browses the menu, adds items to the cart, customizes preferences, selects delivery options, reviews the order, and confirms the purchase.
- **Real-time Order Tracking**: A user opens the app, selects an ongoing order, and views live updates on the delivery person's location and estimated arrival time.
- **Managing Restaurant Menu**: An admin logs in, accesses the backend, and adds, edits, or removes menu items, updating their descriptions, prices, and availability.
- **Handling Delivery Delays**: A delivery person encounters unexpected traffic, notifies the system, and provides revised estimated delivery time to both the restaurant and the customer.
- **User Profile Management**: A user creates an account, logs in, updates personal information, adds payment methods, and manages delivery addresses.
- **Inventory Management**: The system monitors ingredient levels for a restaurant, alerts staff when supplies are low, and temporarily removes out-of-stock items from the menu.
- **Customer Support Interaction**: A user contacts customer support through the app, reports an issue with an order, and receives timely assistance and resolution.
- **Promotional Campaign**: The restaurant initiates a special offer, such as a discount code, and users apply the code during checkout to receive the specified benefit.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: An admin accesses the system's analytics dashboard to view key performance indicators, sales trends, and customer feedback.
- **Integration with Payment Gateway**: A user proceeds to checkout, enters payment details, and the system securely processes the payment through an external payment gateway.

The decision to focus on the "Placing a New Food Order" and "Real-time Order Tracking" scenarios is driven by their essential role in meeting core user needs. "Placing a New Food Order" directly aligns with the app's primary objective of enabling convenient and efficient order placement, while "Real-time Order Tracking" addresses the critical user expectation for real-time visibility into their delivery progress. By prioritizing these scenarios, we aim to establish a solid foundation for user satisfaction and effective order management within the *{project-title}* app.
