NOTE: This document is provided for pedagogical use only, in the context of a requirements engineering courses delivered at McMaster University. **This is not a reference example of good requirements, as it deliberatly contains flaws, errors and mistakes**. 

This requirements document has been generated with the assistance of an AI language model. It is essential to acknowledge that while AI technology is a powerful tool, there are inherent limitations and potential flaws in using it to write requirements. As an AI language model, it operates based on patterns in data and past examples, which may not always capture the nuanced complexities of real-world scenarios.

The document may contain inaccuracies, ambiguities, or oversights due to the model's inability to comprehend context and intent as a human requirements engineer would. The AI-generated content might lack domain-specific knowledge, may not align with the latest industry practices, and could overlook critical requirements crucial for the success of the project.

Readers must exercise caution and critical thinking when interpreting the content. The requirements herein should be carefully reviewed, refined, and validated by experienced human requirements engineers and stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the project's context, objectives, and domain. The creators of the AI language model and this requirements document do not assume responsibility for any negative consequences arising from reliance solely on AI-generated content for critical decision-making in software development projects.

NOTE: **We will intensively use this document during the lectures** to spot the mistakes that were made by the AI language model, and demonstrate the value requirements engineers adds to a project.
